    PANELROOM — Enterprise Brand Mark
    
    CONCEPT: "The Convergence"
    Two angular panels meeting at a precise point, forming a unified gateway.
    
    MEANING:
    - Two panels = Interviewer + Candidate
    - The meeting point = The interview moment
    - The opening/negative space = Opportunity, the path forward
    - Angular precision = Professionalism, structure
    
    INSPIRATION: Architectural, like a modern building facade or doorway
    Works as silhouette. Timeless. Enterprise.
