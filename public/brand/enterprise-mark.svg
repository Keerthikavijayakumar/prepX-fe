    PANELROOM — Enterprise Brand Mark
    
    CONCEPT: "The Dialogue Window"
    
    A bold rounded square (the professional space/room) with an inner 
    geometric chevron pointing upward (growth, progress, the conversation 
    elevating both parties).
    
    The chevron also subtly suggests two elements meeting at a point -
    representing the interviewer and candidate connecting.
    
    MEANING:
    - Outer square = The Room, professional environment, structure
    - Inner chevron = Dialogue, growth, two parties meeting
    - Upward direction = Progress, career advancement, success
    
    DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    - Single color works (silhouette test ✓)
    - Recognizable at 16px (favicon test ✓)
    - Timeless geometry, not trendy
    - Enterprise feel, not playful
